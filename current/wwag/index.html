<meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The working title on a manuscript that I hope to finish by 2020, this starts with a simple question - how did we arrive at the current Scientific Method, and better yet, why haven&#39;t we found something better? The first insight is that the current method we use today is one of many different methods presented through the course of history. Our current method was first described by Francis Bacon in the 1600s. On a deeper read of his works, you find that not only was he a fountain of brilliance, he also foresaw many of the necessary complications of having humans in the loop. The method we use today was explicitly engineered to manage the biases introduced by humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where We Are Going presents this historical view then asks the question: “What prevents us from realizing Bacon’s vision for a knowledge generating machine?”. The second section presents an NLP-based approach that aims to codify a researcher&#39;s intuition and make it computable. The third and final section integrates the computable substrate with modern software development techniques like version control, data federation, and continuous integration to outline a scalable knowledge system with a proposed meaningful incentive alignment across all types of scientist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
